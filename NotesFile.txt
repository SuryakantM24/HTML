INTRODUCTION 
//LECTURE 1

WEB DEVELOPMENT

Used to create Websites(Static content eg WIKIPEDIA) and Web Apps(Dynamic webpages eg LINKEDIN)


//Now a days user interactive web apps are developed mostly . thesa act as products for many product based companies.


WEB APPS :
   
   3 Layers--
         -- FRONT END ( especially developd for USER)
            all users interact with FRONTEND(UI/UX) of web apps
            HTML,CSS,JS, FRAMEWORKS.
            (FRONTEND ENGINEER).

         --BACKEND BRAIN of WEBAPPS. entire logic is written in backend.
           developers interact with backend.
           JAVASCRIPT,JAVA,NODEJS.
           (BACKEND ENGINEER)

         --DATA BASE Layer.   to store data and state.
           Many Databases are used LIKE SQL,NOSQL Data bases.
           eg MySQL,MONGO DB(No Sql),CASSANDRA(NoSql)

        //(FRONT AND BACKEND):- FULLSTACK WEB DEVELOPMENT;



STACK WE ARE USING 
              MERN
              M- MONGO DB
              E- EXPRESS JS
              R- REACT JS FRAMEWORK
              N- NODE JS RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT




Note :-DOCUMENTATION IS GOD 



//LECTURE 2 . (NETWORK,WEB,INTERNET)

NETWORK:- INTERCONNECTED devices on large scale.

eg. LAN(Local Area Netwok), MAN(Metropolitan Area NETWORK), WAN(Wide area Network)

// can we wired, satallite connected.

Internet:- Global/ Network of Networks(Billions of Devices)

WWW:- world wide web.its subset of  Internet



IP address:- Unique address of a device. if communication is to be made between two machines.



Browser :--     Docs , resources,website,webpages on internet can be accessed using a application named as Browser.

Browser Engine:- Web realted files can be use to render using browser engine.


CLIENT/SERVER MODEL :-               req.  (get,put,post)

                    CLIENT-----------> SERVER
                          <-----------
                            response.




CLIENT(Laptop,mobile,pc,) etc.
      we can also call browser,app,command line inteface as CLIENT.





eg.          
      user request [www.fb.com(Mapped to IP address, DNS server convert this domain name to IP address)]--------> [fb server]
                                                                                                       <--------- [response.]


     Note:-  DNS server convert this domain name to IP address,this process is called as DOMAIN NAME RESOLUTION




//LECTURE 3 (HOW INTERNET WORKS)


SMALL CHUNKS OF DATA are called Packets


ISP- Internet Service Provider



CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE

                     REQ(GET,SET,PUSH)
        CLIENT -----------------------------> SERVER
              <------------------------------



CLIENT (REQ. url)-------->ISP------> SERVER

       

       application |   (Protocol)             | application|
       ------------                            ------------
       TCP         |   (PORT NO)              |    TCP     |
       ------------                            -----------
       ISP         |   (IP ADDRESS)           |    IP      |
       ------------                            -----------
       Hardware    | ------->[INTERNET]------>| Hardware   |



       REQUEST CONTAINS(App Protocol,PORT NO, IP ADDRESS)




PROTOCOLS :- 
          HTTP (Hyper text transfer Protocol);
          FTP  (file transfer Protocol)
          SMTP (Simple mail transfer Protocol);
